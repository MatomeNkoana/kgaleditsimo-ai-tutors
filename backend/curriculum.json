Core Definition</h3><p>Titrimetry (or Titrimetric Analysis) is a group of quantitative analytical methods in which the amount of an analyte is determined by measuring the quantity of a reagent of known concentration that reacts essentially completely with the analyte.</p><h3>2. Fundamental Vocabulary</h3><ul><li><strong>Titrant:</strong> The reagent solution of known concentration (usually in the burette).</li><li><strong>Analyte (Titrand):</strong> The solution containing the sample of unknown concentration (usually in the flask).</li><li><strong>Equivalence Point:</strong> The <em>theoretical</em> point where the moles of titrant added are chemically equivalent to the moles of analyte.</li><li><strong>End Point:</strong> The <em>experimental</em> point where a physical change (e.g., color change) signals you to stop.</li><li><strong>Titration Error:</strong> The difference between the Equivalence Point and the End Point ($E_t = V_{ep} - V_{eq}$).</li></ul><h3>3. Standards (The Reference System)</h3><p>To ensure accuracy, we rely on two types of standards:</p><ul><li><strong>Primary Standard:</strong> A highly purified compound (>99.9%), stable in air, with high molar mass. This is the ultimate reference (e.g., KHP).</li><li><strong>Standardization:</strong> The process of determining the exact concentration of a secondary standard by titrating it against a primary standard.</li></ul><h3>4. Classification of Methods</h3><p>We classify methods in two ways:</p><h4>A. By Measurement Principle (Technique)</h4><ul><li><strong>Volumetric:</strong> Measures volume of liquid reagent (Tool: Burette).</li><li><strong>Gravimetric:</strong> Measures mass of liquid reagent (Tool: Balance).</li><li><strong>Coulometric:</strong> Measures electrical charge (Tool: Electrodes).</li></ul><h4>B. By Chemical Reaction</h4><ul><li><strong>Neutralization:</strong> Acid-Base proton transfer.</li><li><strong>Precipitation:</strong> Formation of low-solubility solid (e.g., AgCl).</li><li><strong>Complexometric:</strong> Formation of soluble complex (e.g., EDTA).</li><li><strong>Redox:</strong> Electron transfer.</li></ul>",
